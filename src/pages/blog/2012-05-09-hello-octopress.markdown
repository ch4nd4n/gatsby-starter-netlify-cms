If for some reason it's not obvious, this site is powered by Octopress. I  am 
fascinated with simplicity of octopress. After playing around with it for sometime,
I find that Octopress is a fun to use piece of work. The foremost thing <!-- more -->
that I love about this change is that I can edit the site in vim! Updating it on
heroku is a git push away.

I am yet to try embedding video etc but I am sure that it's all going to be fun.
