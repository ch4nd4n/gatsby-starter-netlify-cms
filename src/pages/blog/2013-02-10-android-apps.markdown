Some handy apps and tricks on Google Android

### Music
Google Music - On desktop go to [Google Music](http://music.google.com) website. You will have to signup with your account for the first time, if you haven't already. To upload music, you will have to download and install *music manager* on your system. Once music manager is installed show it the folder from where you want to upload your mp3 files. This activity could be a long process depending on how many files and size of the data to be uploaded. Please note that this will consume a lot of bandwidth in case you have a lot of songs to upload.
