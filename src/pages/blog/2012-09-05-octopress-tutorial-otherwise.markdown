> Octopress is not very active. Nor do I intend to update this.

### Introduction
It is said very eloquently on Octopress home page and I quote

> Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages. To start blogging with Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration.

Now before that really scares you away, let me tell you that, all that is not really very difficult. It may sound intimidating in the beginning
but its not so. Of course if you know nothing about HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. you may find it difficult to customize it.

I would primarily cover blogging basics first, assuming that, you are already all set with Octopress
### Blogging basics
There are various formats in which one can blog an article. My preferred format is Markdown. Primarily
because I want to master it. Other format that I use is HTML. You can mix and match formats.

##### Create a new blog entry
{% highlight ruby %}
rake new_post["title"]
{% endhighlight %}
##### Create a new page
{% highlight shell %}
rake new_page["title"]
{% endhighlight %}

##### Including Gist

##### Including an image

### Work in progress
